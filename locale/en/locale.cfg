[entity-description]
	boat=Small and fast boat with small inventory space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an independent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
	indep-boat=Small and fast boat with small inventory space. Can be placed either on water ways or as an independent vehicle. Enter and leave the boat with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
	cargo_ship=Large cargo ship able to transport vast amount of resources. Enter and leave the ship with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
	oil_tanker=Large tanker ship able to transport vast amount of fluids. Enter and leave the ship with __CONTROL__enter_ship__.
	ship_pump=Special pump for loading and unloading tanker ships. Can be placed on water. Doesn't collide with ships and needs to placed close to the water ways.
	oil_rig=Massive swimming extraction platform for deep sea oil. Includes its own local power generation and electric network, supplying the oil rig itself as well as connected ship loading pumps with energy.
	deep_oil=Large deposit of deep sea oil. Extract with an oil rig.
	port=Destinations for automated ships.
	buoy=Divides the water way system into blocks, allowing multiple ships to run on the same network.
	chain_buoy=Reads the next signals in the path to allow better control of ships.
	bridge_north_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_east_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_south_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_west_clickable=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
	bridge_base=Automated train bridge, that opens to let ships pass underneath. Place along an existing straight stretch of waterway. Recommended to use same signaling as with normal train-crossing.
