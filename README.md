# Cargo Ships
Create a network of ships, similar to trains, but slower, bulkier, with integrated engines, and on water. Take advantage of offshore oil, and have access to a personal boat vehicle. Just like rails, you place water ways, ports, signal buoys...

## Features
 - 3 railed ships (tanker, cargo ship, small boat)
 - 1 vehicle boat (SHIFT + ENTER to board)
 - Water ways (rails), port (train stop), buoy and chain-buoy (rail signals), retractable rail bridge (makes crossing rails and water ways possible)
 - Oil rig (to pump offshore oil), floating electric pole (transmit but doesn't distribute electricity), floating pump
 - 8 technologies

## Main settings
 - Oil spwning frequency
 - Land oil disableable
 - Reach distance modifier for water buildings

## Tips
To generate water-rich maps, change the terrain-settings for water to very low frequency & huge size or use one of the islands mods.
